        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The users cannot see the items in the head section, only the developer, as it's used to help the browser interpret the page.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li> 
      <li>Inline styles are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
      <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isnt true or has a value that isnt truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
      <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
      <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
      <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
      <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of zero, not one.</li>
      <li>A forloop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
      <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
      <li>A functions name is followed by parentheses.</li>
