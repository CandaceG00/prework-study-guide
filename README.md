# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for students who are enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp. It contains notes for each main subject that will be discussed throughout the course, mainly: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was designed to assist the students in learning and retaining the information. This allows the curriculum to be stored in one central place instead of notes in various locations. This has taught me personally the value of having centralized notes.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used to access information throughout the bootcamp. Each section contains notes tailored to that specific category. For example, the GIT section contains the outline of steps in the process of pushing and pulling the information from GitHub. This includes the steps of git pull origin main, and git checkout -b to change branches.
